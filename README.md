##PhotoLabs
PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view and interact with photos. It is built using React, Express.js, and a PostgreSQL database.

##Goal
The goal of this project is to build a client-side application using React that provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and interacting with photos.

##Functional Requirements
Develop a React SPA called PhotoLabs.
Utilize a PostgreSQL database as the data layer.
Implement an API server using Node.js and Express.js.
Communicate with the API server over HTTP using the JSON format.
Behavioural Requirements
PhotoLabs provides the following functionalities for users:

View photos from the homepage, loaded from the API.
Navigate to different photo categories, known as topics.
Click on a photo to view a larger version of the photo and related/similar photos.
Like a photo from anywhere within the application where the photo is displayed.
View a heart icon with a notification in the navigation if there are liked photos.
Persist data by making API requests to load and save data. The relevant data should not be lost after a session restarts or browser refresh.

##Technical Specifications
 Here will be technical specification

#The PhotoLabs application is built using the following technologies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Create React App: A tool for bootstrapping React applications.
Webpack: A module bundler used for building the client-side application.
Babel: A JavaScript compiler used for transpiling modern JavaScript code.
Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
During development, two different servers will be running:

Client-side Webpack development server: Provides a live development environment for the client-side application.
API server: Serves as the backend and provides the necessary data for the client-side application.
Installation and Setup
To run the PhotoLabs application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the dependencies for both the client-side and API server using npm install.
Configure the PostgreSQL database according to the provided instructions.
Start the API server using npm start or node server.js.
Start the client-side development server using npm start.
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
